We design our database relationships so that trips would be the central piece of it. The main page each user accesses is the travel log which is a reference of all trips undertaken. Hypothetically, a trip can have few different users and can be composed of several countries. For version one though, we maintain a simple relation, one trip = one user = one country.

## Process

- Planing: writing this readme and designing the wireframes
![alt Wireframes](https://github.com/MR-Neto/TravelLog/blob/master/readmeAssets/wireframes.jpeg)

- First iteration of the app
![alt First Iteration](https://github.com/MR-Neto/TravelLog/blob/master/readmeAssets/first-iteration.jpg)

- MVP was created entirely in pair programming to give us the same base before spliting tasks on backlog features. Also, we decided to work in pair when dealing with complicated features like implementing Instagram authentication through it API. And again when performing Mongo queries to calculate our travel statistics. This turned out to be very beneficial to our project.
